I saw a post somewhere (I think on Hacker News) about a series of pure
javascript videos from Wes Bos. I'd watched his react videos just about a year
ago and thought they were good so I took a look at his new videos as well as
seeing what else he has up (was thinking some angular2 vids couldn't hurt) and
saw he had a series on flexbox. This was the first I'd heard of this but it
seemed useful so I started watching them. I'm a big over halfway through now
and it seems like I could ditch the CSS framework I'm using on the blog and
go with this instead. I only really have the framework for the layout aspects
so doesn't seem like a need now that CSS apparently isn't such a pain to work
with as it used to be. I also think I am going to use 'thistle' as a highlight
color on the blog. Achromous means without color but I feel like having very
minimal color usage will actually draw attention to the monochromaticity than
having no color at all. But we'll see how it looks. Thistle is a pretty dope
color though.

The videos in the other course look like they'll be interesting as well. The
first project is a drum kit webpage which is extra interesting for me right now
as I just started the Deadmau5 masterclass on electronic music production
(always trying to learn new things). One of the other videos is going to cover
working with the webcam which is also cool because I am interested in putting
together a site I can use to video chat with my friends more easily than
anything I have seen that is out there.

Mainly just plugging away learning stuff - more things I want to learn than
there is time - even when I'm unemployed.

I also picked up a new mini display to HDMI adaptor today as the cheap one I
picked up before didn't support the resolution of my 28" 4k display. I now am
writing this on my surface pro 4 which I have hooked up to my monitor,
keyboard, and speakers. It is a pretty nice setup and I don't have to worry
about wanting to work somewhere else and not having my latest code (which is
something that can be solved with git but I also don't love checking things in
until they provide at least some basic level of functionality). The desktop
I recently built is probably going to sit disconnected until I at least have a
job listing scraper built, if not a full blown job application program. Less
distraction from quick breaks to play Overwatch this way. Still really wish
I hadn't built that thing the week before getting laid off - but life does
what life does.
