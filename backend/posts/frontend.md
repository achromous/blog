title: State of the State... or the frontend
---
I based the frontend on the Angular2 Tour of Heroes tutorial that I read
through before starting. I figured if I don't really know what I'm doing it
makes sense to base things on the setup the Angular people put together.

Some of the things I want to address are:

###### Make things look nice
A proper

###### Order posts by date (and display the date)

###### A "Contact Me" form
Totally silly, but I want to try out forms with Angular2.

###### Build a tag cloud

###### add filtering on the tag cloud

###### Search
