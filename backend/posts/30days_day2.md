title: A Steam Clock Journey Continues
---
On the second day of steam clock my true love gave to me:

A clock built from css manipulation.

Really, day two was a clock - I couldn't believe my luck. The video focused on
the javascript and css needed to get the hands of a clock to work. You can
see that [here](http://achromo.us/30_days_javascript/day_2/video_version/index.html)

I took that and then changed the styling a bit. I removed the second hand (steam
clock doesn't have one) and added chiming on the quarter of the hour as the
steam clock does. And on the hour it blows the longer whistle one time per hour
of the day. You can see that
[here](http://achromo.us/30_days_javascript/day_2/me_version/index.html)
although to experience the wonderment of the chiming you may need to wait up to
fifteen minutes for it to go off. Obviously it is worth waiting for.

However when I showed this to my wonderful friends who are blessed with working
meters away from the steam clock one of them pointed out that I had gotten it
wrong. I did not realize that each quarter of the hour has a different tune.
I had programmed the first two bars of the third quarter tune to go off at every
quarter. Shameful.

So this is something I still need to resolve. I also would like to improve the
styling a bit. The numbers aren't QUITE perfect with how they are laid out, and
I would like to add more elements to make it look more like the glorious steam
clock. Also steam coming out would be pretty awesome. But I'm moving on for now
as I have lots of things to do. Also because positioning numbers around a clock
is a pain in the butt.
