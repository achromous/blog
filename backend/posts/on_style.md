When I originally slapped this thing together I didn't really give any thought
to planning how it was going to look. I had a loose hierarchy in mind of the
overall structure but beyond that I was going to figure it out later. Well now
is later. I banged through the book On Web Typography yesterday. It was okay,
lot of retreading of font stuff I already knew, but I was interested in the
two final chapters which were more on overall layout. Again stuff I'd all mostly
read before but it helped going over it again.

So now I have a more concrete idea of what I want to put together. I'm going to
do at least two versions - one for mobile and one for normal ol screens. I am
going to use flexbox to make an 8 column grid type layout. I spent some time
messing with some different typefaces last night and am going to probably stick
with a free garamond version that google hosts. I might try a different one for
headings and the menu but I am going to try a semi-bold garamond font with a
different color first.

So I'm starting in on that a bit. It shouldn't actually take me very long to do
except anything like this involves tons of fiddling and trying various versions.
I think I'm going to start in on the tag cloud as well. I should also bang out
a proper backend soon. It should be fairly trivial so there is no real reason
not to. The only thing I'm a bit unsure about is the database. I don't REALLY
want that on the same container as the backend and I think I'll have to bump
up my instance size if I add another container. Or I could use one of the AWS
options - never done that before so I might learn something. Need to check out
the pricing on that.
