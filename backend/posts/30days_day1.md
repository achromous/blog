title: A Steam Clock Journey Begins
---
I saw a post on hacker news from Wes Bos about the new set of videos he put
together. He made 30 videos on 30 different projects that don't use any
libraries up [here](https://javascript30.com/). As I'm trying to keep banging
the rust off my skills and doing a number of things will expose me to a variety
of problems and help get me back up to fighting shape.

The first project was a drum kit webpage. I followed along with the video and
got the project working myself. It is up
[here](http://achromo.us/30_days_javascript/day_1/video_version/index.html). I
was originally thinking about adding looping so that a user could add the
various sounds to a few bars that would repeat. However the prerecorded sounds
weren't that compelling so it didn't really seem like it was worth doing. I next
had the idea to make a game, like simon. A series of sounds would play and the
user would have to play them back in order.

It was at this point that I had the magnificent idea of using the notes of the
steam clock in Vancouver. The Vancouver steam clock is the pinnacle of Canadian
achievement and 30 steam clock themed javascript projects would be the smallest
of tributes I could make.

The end result is here:

It took me a few hours to bang out. It was all generally pretty straight forward
other than the CSS. Flexbox seemed pretty simple in the videos but making it do
what I wanted was a bit more complicated. A bit of googling and some fiddling
sorted that though.

If I am ever inclined to touch this again I might add score tracking for each
session. Other than that there isn't really anything that comes to mind that
it would need. Fun bit of coding.
