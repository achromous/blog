I started working on some jobomatic stuff earlier this morning but wasn't super
feeling it. I did feeling like cranking through some of these javascrip 30
videos however. I started the day with day 3 and am presently ripping through
day 7. So far nothing has struck me as very exciting about modifying any of
these so I haven't. But some comments:

Day 3 is about CSS variables. I didn't know you could use variables in CSS now,
so this is great. I plan in sticking them in the styles for the blog when I
hack a way on it a bit more tonight. I'm trying to improve the style a bit here
and a bit there until I like it.

Day 4 was running functions on arrays. Review but as I may be going through
tech screens in the near future I figured it didn't hurt so I followed along.

Day 5 was some more flex stuff. Pretty straightforward as I already went through
all the flex videos.

Day 6 was a typeahead. Nothing crazy here really, but good to see I guess.

Day 7 is more array functions. Short video and still review. I hadn't seen the
`...` ES6 spread thing prior to these videos (it came up in earlier videos but
  seeing it again here prompted me to mention it), glad I have now.

Day 8 is making a drawing gadget using canvas. I worked with canvas waaaay back
a while ago in some fiddles when I took a crack at writing something to organize
my books by the color of their spine, but I haven't touched it since, so this
should be a nice review. One thing I noticed is my mouse seems to be sending
WAY more move events than his, probably from my settings having low sensitivity
so I can pretend I'm good at Overwatch.

Day 9 is on some dev tools tricks. I didn't know about console.assert, that is
pretty cool. Gotta say - Wes gets you hooked with something more fun at the
start and then bangs through some duller lessons before (hoepfully) getting back
to fun stuff once this is out of the way. Day 30 is a whack-a-mole game, so at
least that should be fun. I am also really jazzed about the webcam one on day
19 and maaaaay end up doing that one out of order.

Day 9 is as far as I made it. I also did a bit more work cleaning up the site's
CSS. I am presently no longer embarrassed about what it looks like, although I am
not exactly proud of it either so I'll still be improving it over the long run.
